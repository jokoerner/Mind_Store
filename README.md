# Mind Store

Mind Store transforms your iPhone or iPad into your second mind. We reinterpreted the notebook. The result is not just an app to take notes, it is a companion for your everyday life that allows you to store entire thoughts.

You can take notes consisting of texts, images, audio recordings and locations in an astonishingly simple way and save it under a chosen keyword. Not only does that allow you to store entire moments, using the alphabetical register and the quick search you can even find old notes in a matter of seconds.
Or course you can then share everything with other people in different manners.

If you own an Apple Watch you can take the simplicity of taking notes in Mind Store to the next level and simply dictate a note and/or save your current location.
Furthermore Mind Store can show you locations nearby that you have tagged in a note before (if you so wish).

Designing Mind Store we succeeded in combining a uniquely beautiful and intuitive interface with a huge amount of functionality.


Store your thoughts and stop forgetting.

- Intuitive design paired with perfect beauty
- Loads of functionality, simple usage
- Perfect interaction with the Apple Watch

What do you want to remember? The possibilities are endless.

The future awaits you.
